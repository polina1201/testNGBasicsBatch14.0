---------Data Provider-----------
Used for dataDriven testing
 DataProviders in TestNG are another way to pass the parameters in the test function. DataProviders pass different values to the TestNG Test Case in a single execution
@DataProvider

--> we provide our data under this annotations and should name our data provider @DataProvider(name="abc")

-->in which ever test case we want to use this data we simply link the data provider to that test case
  @Test(dataprovider="abc")

//dataprovider -->use it when u have small data
in case of larger data use excel file


if we want our test case to utilize this dataprovider
what do we need to do?
@test(dataprovider ="name of dataprovider")
public void test(){


}
-----------listeners in testNG---

Listeners:

Listeners class listen to events like test failed /pass /skipped e.t.c
once the testcase has executed, and it either fails /pass /skips,
depending upon the status, listeneres class takes you to the execution of the code that you have written for the scenarios
if your test case fails/ pass or skips


Implentation of listeners class:

listeners class implements ITestListeneres

which is an interface from TestNG
and we overRide the functions in it according to our need

after that you need to link the listeners class to the class on which you want it to listen
that can be done using TextNG.XML

u define ur <listeners> tag just under <suite>
